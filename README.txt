GitHub Usage:

Issues are used to track things that need to be done.
You need to pick an issue you want to work on and assign it to yourself.
When finished and you feel like there are no errors, you may close the issue.
On the website, click on your name on top right corner ->  Under popular repositories click "LegendOfShimo" -> Issues(On right side under "Code" tab) -> click on an issue you would like to work on -> On right side under "Assignee" click "assign yourself".
When finished, come back to this place and in the middle of the page is a "Close issue" button. Try to focus only on one issue, and if you are struggling a lot with the issue, change the assignee to someone else and pick another issue.

Uploading your code/changes.
The app will automatically see what changes you have made and it will put it under "Uncommitted change". Give it a description that makes it for everyone to see what you have changed in your Commit. When finished with the description, press Commit to master and then click "Sync" in top right corner.
Please make a backup of your code before you come here as I have not tested what would happed if you sync new code to your code.(Will it overwrite your code or will it just not sync?)
Before starting to code, please sync anyway to make sure you have the latest code.
